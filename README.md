# Python-Projects

### Situation

I identified a need for practical, user-friendly tools to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and mortgage payments. Additionally, I saw an opportunity to demonstrate web scraping skills by extracting data from a real website.

### Task

1. Develop a BMI Calculator using Python
2. Create a Mortgage Calculator using Python
3. Implement a web scraping script to extract data from an actual website

### Action

1. BMI Calculator:
    - Designed a Python script to take user input for height and weight
    - Implemented the BMI calculation formula
    - Added logic to interpret the BMI result (underweight, normal, overweight, etc.)
    - Included error handling for invalid inputs
2. Mortgage Calculator:
    - Created a Python program to accept inputs for loan amount, interest rate, and loan term
    - Implemented the mortgage payment calculation algorithm
    - Added features to display monthly payment and total interest paid
    - Incorporated error checking for user inputs
3. Web Scraping:
    - Selected a suitable website with interesting data to scrape
    - Used Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web scraping
    - Wrote a script to navigate the website's structure and extract relevant data
    - Implemented error handling and respect for the website's robots.txt file
    - Stored the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or database)

### Result

The project resulted in three functional Python applications:

1. A BMI Calculator that accurately computes and interprets BMI based on user input
2. A Mortgage Calculator that provides detailed payment information for home loans
3. A web scraping script that successfully extracts and stores data from a real website

### Key outcomes:

- Demonstrated practical application of Python programming skills
- Created useful tools for health and financial calculations
- Showcased ability to interact with web data through scraping
- Improved understanding of user input handling, error management, and data processing in Python

These applications not only serve practical purposes but also demonstrate a range of Python programming skills, from basic calculations to more complex web interactions.
